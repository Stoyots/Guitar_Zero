## About

Guitar Zero is a beginner-friendly game developed in Lua, created as a first project during the initial phase of our training course. This project served as a great introduction to coding and helped us get accustomed to programming logic.

## Features

- Play along to a single song with a virtual guitar interface.
- Practice your timing and coordination as you strum along with the notes.

## How to Play

1. Download and install the game on your device.
   Or play it online at this adress: https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=141487
3. Select the available song from the playlist.
4. Strum along with the notes as they appear on the screen.
5. Enjoy the music and have fun!

## Team Collaboration

Guitar Zero was developed by a team of three enthusiastic developers over a period of 8 days. Together, we embarked on this coding adventure, learning and growing as we brought our ideas to life.

## Improvements

the game still needs improvements. Many features were discussed by the team during the making of this game. 
- in the current state, the game needs to be rebooted to replay. we could fix this probleme
- track choice : make more songs available for the player
- high score tracker for each song : get some competition going between players
many more improvements could still be made on this game
